Tailwind for css frameworks

i am new to react framework and typescript i saw a tutorial to make this, i am very excited to learn more about react

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

because there are too many external api, env is a bit complicated, so I deployed it on vercel to be able to try it
